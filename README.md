# Hi 👋 I am Dimitrios
## Data Scientist 👨🏽‍💻 focusing on Bioinformatics 🧬

💻 Coding since 2015, fascinated by the endless possibilities of the vast amount of biological data I decided to specialize my ML/DL skills in bioinformatics

🎓 **My education journey**
* (2025.06 - Present) 🎓 PhD in 𝐁𝐢𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐬 at the 𝐈𝐨𝐧𝐢𝐚𝐧 𝐔𝐧𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐲 : Currently, I am pursuing my PhD under the title “Advancing AI for Integrative Bioinformatics in Precision Medicine”, where I focus on developing interpretable and scalable multi-modal AI frameworks that integrate medical imaging, clinical text, and omics data to enhance clinical decision support, disease stratification, biomarker discovery, and personalized treatment planning.
* (2017 - 2020) Minor Degree in 𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 (average grade : 3.82/4) at 𝐃𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐠𝐞, with emphasis on Foundations of Investments, Portfolio Management, and Machine Learning. Check our latest paper titled '𝘈 𝘨𝘦𝘯𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘭𝘪𝘻𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘰𝘧 𝘮𝘶𝘭𝘵𝘪-𝘴𝘰𝘶𝘳𝘤𝘦 𝘧𝘶𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯-𝘣𝘢𝘴𝘦𝘥 𝘧𝘳𝘢𝘮𝘦𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘬 𝘵𝘰 𝘴𝘵𝘰𝘤𝘬 𝘴𝘦𝘭𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯' [[link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1566253523003342)].
* (2015 - 2022) M.Eng in 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐮𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐒𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 (average grade: 9.11/10) at the 𝐍𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐔𝐧𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐨𝐟 𝐀𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐧𝐬 (𝐍𝐓𝐔𝐀) , my year-long thesis project revolved around Machine & Deep Learning Classification and Visual Explanation of Dyslexia and Spelling Deficiency using fMRI Data, where I experimented with GLM 1st Level Analysis, Atlas Analysis, Graph-CNN modeling, and GrandCAM


🔬 **My research journey**
* (2025 - Present) Currently I am 𝐀𝐈 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐫 & 𝐈𝐓 𝐒𝐮𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭 for Mental Health Projects @𝐊𝐋𝐈𝐌𝐀𝐊𝐀: As an AI Researcher and IT Support specialist, I contribute to mental health and suicide prevention initiatives by developing LLM-based dynamic questionnaires and self-assessment tools. I collaborate with clinicians and hospitals to improve early intervention, crisis response, and patient care through ethical and secure AI solutions. I ensure GDPR compliance and support the responsible use of sensitive mental health data across all digital platforms.
* (2021) I later worked as a 𝐌𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐭 at the 𝐁𝐢𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡 𝐅𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐀𝐜𝐚𝐝𝐞𝐦𝐲 𝐨𝐟 𝐀𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐧𝐬 (𝐁𝐑𝐅𝐀𝐀), researching Machine & Deep Learning for 𝘗𝘢𝘳𝘬𝘪𝘯𝘴𝘰𝘯’s classification, using raw tabular data from the Greek 𝘗𝘢𝘳𝘬𝘪𝘯𝘴𝘰𝘯 Database. This involves feature importance analysis, visual explanation techniques, and embedding methods. Presented a poster at the 6th HBP Student Conference on Interdisciplinary Brain Research [[link](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dimitrios-georgiou/overlay/1635484219509/single-media-viewer/?profileId=ACoAAB9iLVIBxYpeomo-Y21fFLHo-YyxI_Rj_vk)].
* (2019) Under the supervision of [Ioannis Micaholopoulos](https://github.com/imichalop), we also researched the severity of COVID-19 and we built a Machine Learning-Based Web Tool. Check our latest paper titled 𝘈 𝘔𝘢𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘦 𝘓𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘯𝘪𝘯𝘨-𝘉𝘢𝘴𝘦𝘥 𝘞𝘦𝘣 𝘛𝘰𝘰𝘭 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘚𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘵𝘺 𝘗𝘳𝘦𝘥𝘪𝘤𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘰𝘧 𝘊𝘖𝘝𝘐𝘋-19 [[link](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-6284/13/3/22)].
* (2019) Initially I pursued an 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐒𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝘈𝘭𝘻𝘩𝘦𝘪𝘮𝘦𝘳-related internship at the 𝐍𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐂𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐒𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐜 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡 "𝐃𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐤𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐨𝐬", where I tackled diagnostic classification using text data from 𝘈𝘭𝘻𝘩𝘦𝘪𝘮𝘦𝘳's patients and was exposed to state-of-the-art NLP models from a biomedical perspective.


💼 **My industry journey**

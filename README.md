# Hi 👋 I am Dimitrios
## Data Scientist 👨🏽‍💻 deep diving into Healthcare & Bioinformatics
☞ M.Eng in Computer Science, my year-long thesis project revolved around Machine Deep Learning Classification and Visual Explanation of Dyslexia and Spelling Deficiency using fMRI Data

💻 Coding since 2015, fascinated by the endless possibilities of the vast amount of biological data I decided to follow a different path into Biomedical Data Science.

👨‍🏫 Having completed all mandatory classes of my Master's studies (average grade: 9.54) I have achieved proficient knowledge in diverse bioinformatics fields (Structural bioinformatics, Image processing and analysis, Bioinformatics algorithms in molecular biology, ML/DL, etc.) with emphasis on Machine Learning and Deep Learning. My thesis project was devoted to time series analysis of biomedical data using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques.

🔬 I seek to combine my biological knowledge with state-of-the-art ML/DL techniques and models in order to produce cutting-edge research through a collaborative effort with other passion-driven scientists and researchers. My research interests lie in genomics and proteomics, biomedical ML/DL, time series analysis, while I constantly seek to achieve a thorough knowledge of new advancements.

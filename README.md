# Hi 👋 I am Dimitrios
## Data Scientist 👨🏽‍💻 focusing on Bioinformatics

💻 Coding since 2015, fascinated by the endless possibilities of the vast amount of biological data I decided to specialize my ML/DL skills in bioinformatics

☞ M.Eng in Computer Science (average grade: 9.11), my year-long thesis project revolved around Machine & Deep Learning Classification and Visual Explanation of Dyslexia and Spelling Deficiency using fMRI Data, where I experimented with GLM 1st Level Analysis, Atlas Analysis, Graph-CNN modeling, and GrandCAM


🔬 My research journey :
* Initially I pursued an 𝘈𝘭𝘻𝘩𝘦𝘪𝘮𝘦𝘳-related internship at the 𝐍𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐂𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐒𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐜 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡 "𝐃𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐤𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐨𝐬", where I tackled diagnostic classification using text data from 𝘈𝘭𝘻𝘩𝘦𝘪𝘮𝘦𝘳's patients and was exposed to state-of-the-art NLP models from a biomedical perspective.
* I later worked as a Machine Learning assistant at the 𝐁𝐢𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡 𝐅𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧, 𝐀𝐜𝐚𝐝𝐞𝐦𝐲 𝐨𝐟 𝐀𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐧𝐬, researching Machine & Deep Learning for 𝘗𝘢𝘳𝘬𝘪𝘯𝘴𝘰𝘯’s classification, using raw tabular data from the Greek 𝘗𝘢𝘳𝘬𝘪𝘯𝘴𝘰𝘯 Database. This involves feature importance analysis, visual explanation techniques, and embedding methods.

* Under the supervision of [Ioannis Micaholopoulos](https://github.com/imichalop)

💼 My industry journey :
* Local Operations Intern (Data Analytics) @Uber: Using Advanced SQL, Python to analyze data, gather business insights and understand
rider/driver behavior as well as areas for improvement
* Automation Specialist (Advanced Data Analytics) @Uber: Data Extraction, Data Analysis, Data Visualisations, Machine Learning, Automation. Implemented and maintaining 25+ automation/data science projects (real-time, non real-time)

👨‍🏫 I seek to combine machine learning knowledge in various fields (transportation, finance, healthcare) with my research interest in biological data through a collaborative effort with other passion-driven scientists and researchers. My research interests lie in the fields of genomics, biomedical ML/DL, and time series analysis, while I constantly seek a thorough knowledge of new advancements.


* 🌍  I'm based in Krakow, Poland 🇵🇱
